# Methods

\newcommand{\s}{\boldsymbol{s}}

We fit geostatistical models using the R package sdmTMB [@sdmTMB], which implements spatial and spatiotemporal predictive-process GLMMs using the SPDE (stochastic partial differential equation) approximation to Gaussian random fields. sdmTMB fits geostatistical models with maximum marginal likelihood calculated with TMB [Template Model Builder, @kristensen2016] and the Laplace approximation and uses an SPDE "mesh" constructed with the R package INLA [@lindgren2015].
Previous work has shown that such an approach can improve the accuracy and precision of population indices from fisheries independent surveys [e.g., @thorson2015ices] and commercial CPUE [e.g., @gruss2019a].

The general structure of the models is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[y_{\s,t}] &= \mu_{\s,t},\\
\mu_{\bm{s},t} &=
f^{-1} \left( \bm{X}_{\bm{s},t} \bm{\beta} +
O_{\s,t} +
\omega_{\s} +
\epsilon_{\s,t} \right),\\
\boldsymbol{\omega} &\sim \operatorname{MVNormal} \left( \boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\omega \right),\\
\boldsymbol{\epsilon_{t}} &\sim \operatorname{MVNormal} \left( \boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\epsilon} \right),
\end{aligned}
$$

where $y_{\s,t}$ represents blue marlin bycatch counts at coordinates $\s$ in space and time $t$, 
$\mu$ represents the mean,
$f$ represents a link function and $f^{-1}$ represents its inverse, 
$\bm{X}$ represents a design matrix, 
$\bm{\beta}$ represents a vector of main-effect coefficients, 
$O_{\s,t}$ represents an offset of log hook count, 
$\omega_{\bm{s}}$ represents a spatial Gaussian random field with mean zero and covariance $\bm{\Sigma}_\omega$, and
$\epsilon_{\s,t}$ represents a spatiotemporal Gaussian random field with mean zero and covariance $\bm{\Sigma}_{\epsilon}$.
For main effects, we used factor (categorical) predictors for year, season, and light-stick presence as well as a linear predictor for log hooks between floats.

There are several ways these models can be configured.
We evaluated four families: NB2, NB1, delta-gamma, and delta-lognormal.
We initially tested the Tweedie distribution, but consistently had challenges with model convergence. We evaluated three random field configurations: (1) no random fields, (2) spatial random fields, and (3) spatial and spatiotemporal random fields with the spatiotemporal random fields being independent each year. Based on initial testing, we let the range parameter, which defines the distance at which spatial correlation has decayed to about 13%, be independent between the spatial and spatiotemporal random fields. We also allowed for spatial anisotropy [@fuglstad2015a; @thorson2015ices]: spatial correlation that varies with direction. Here, we shared the anisotropy properties between the spatial and spatiotemporal fields since they can be challenging to estimate.
For sdmTMB, this means we used the arguments `anisotropy = TRUE, share_range = FALSE, spatial = "on",` and `spatiotemporal = "iid"` for our full spatiotemporal model; the anisotropy is by default shared but can be configured within `sdmTMBcontrol()` via the `map` argument.

mesh details: cutoff of 5 and 3 TODO
note convergence can be finicky with mesh here

TODO projection Albers...

A projection matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ was used to bilinearly interpolate random field values at the triangle vertex locations ($\boldsymbol{\omega}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^*$) to the values at the locations of the observed or predicted data [@lindgren2015]: $\boldsymbol{\omega}^* = \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\omega}$ and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^* = \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$. 
The matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ has a row for each data point and a column for each vertex defining the weight of the neighbouring three vertices.
The negative marginal log likelihood was then minimized with the non-linear optimization routine `stats::nlminb()` in R [@gay1990; @r2021] followed by a Newton optimization routine `stats::optimHess()` in R [@r2021] to further reduce the likelihood gradients with respect to fixed effects if needed.
Using `sdmTMB::sanity()`, we assessed convergence by checking that the Hessian matrix was positive definite, that all gradients with respect to fixed effects were $<$ 0.001, and that no random field standard deviations were too small (< 0.01; suggesting the parameter had 'collapsed' to zero) among other checks.

To derive predicted total bycatch on the logbook data, we predicted from our model on the logbook data and summed the predicted bycatch each year.
We calculated standard errors on the log value of this total via the generalized delta method [as implemented in TMB, @kristensen2016] and calculated 95% Wald confidence intervals as $\pm$ 1.96 the standard error in log space.
We compared models with AIC, evaluated model fit via randomized quantile residuals, and calculated summary statistics of MARE (median absolute relative error), MRE (mean relative error), and coverage (the proportion of years in which the true value was within the confidence interval).

# Results

- seems to be strong anisotropy Fig.\ \@ref(fig:aniso) ... but think about projection
- coverage worse and metrics worse if no spatiotemporal or no fields at all
- convergence can be finicky with properties of mesh! priors would help
- exactly which family comes out on top is sensitive to the mesh
- all decent families
- just spatial gets you most of the way there
- adding spatiotemporal helps a bit and mostly with appropriate CI coverage
- big benefit adding spatial fields, smaller benefit adding spatiotemporal
- NB2 or NB2 consistently had coverage closest to 95%
- spatiotemporal sigmaE collapsed for delta US models
