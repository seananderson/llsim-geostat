# Methods

\newcommand{\s}{\boldsymbol{s}}

We fit geostatistical models using the R package sdmTMB [@sdmTMB], which implements spatial and spatiotemporal predictive-process GLMMs using the SPDE (stochastic partial differential equation) approximation to Gaussian random fields.
sdmTMB fits geostatistical models with maximum marginal likelihood calculated with TMB [Template Model Builder, @kristensen2016] and the Laplace approximation and uses a "mesh" constructed with the R package INLA [@lindgren2015] for the SPDE approximation and bilinear interpolation.
Previous work has shown that such an approach can improve the accuracy and precision of population indices from fisheries independent surveys [e.g., @thorson2015ices] and commercial CPUE [e.g., @gruss2019a].

The general structure of the models is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[y_{\s,t}] &= \mu_{\s,t},\\
\mu_{\bm{s},t} &=
f^{-1} \left( \bm{X}_{\bm{s},t} \bm{\beta} +
O_{\s,t} +
\omega_{\s} +
\epsilon_{\s,t} \right),\\
\boldsymbol{\omega} &\sim \operatorname{MVNormal} \left( \boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_\omega \right),\\
\boldsymbol{\epsilon_{t}} &\sim \operatorname{MVNormal} \left( \boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\epsilon} \right),
\end{aligned}
$$

where $y_{\s,t}$ represents blue marlin bycatch counts at coordinates $\s$ in space and time $t$,
$\mu$ represents the mean,
$f$ represents a link function and $f^{-1}$ represents its inverse,
$\bm{X}$ represents a design matrix,
$\bm{\beta}$ represents a vector of main-effect coefficients,
$O_{\s,t}$ represents an offset of log hook count,
$\omega_{\bm{s}}$ represents a spatial Gaussian random field with mean zero and covariance $\bm{\Sigma}_\omega$, and
$\epsilon_{\s,t}$ represents a spatiotemporal Gaussian random field with mean zero and covariance $\bm{\Sigma}_{\epsilon}$.
For main effects, we used factor (categorical) predictors for year, season, and light-stick presence as well as a linear predictor for log hooks between floats.

There are several ways these models can be configured.
We evaluated four families: NB2, NB1, delta-gamma, and delta-lognormal.
We initially tested the Tweedie distribution, but had challenges with model convergence unless the model was fit to CPUE instead of bycatch with an offset.
We therefore excluded it here, but future work could include it.
We evaluated three random field configurations: (1) no random fields, (2) spatial random fields, and (3) spatial and spatiotemporal random fields with the spatiotemporal random fields being independent each year. 
Based on initial testing, we let the range parameter, which defines the distance at which spatial correlation has decayed to about 13%, be independent between the spatial and spatiotemporal random fields. 
We also allowed for spatial anisotropy [@fuglstad2015a; @thorson2015ices]: spatial correlation that varies with direction. 
Here, we shared the anisotropy properties between the spatial and spatiotemporal fields since they can be challenging to estimate.
For sdmTMB, this means we used the arguments `anisotropy = TRUE, share_range = FALSE, spatial = "on",` and `spatiotemporal = "iid"` for our full spatiotemporal model; the anisotropy is by default shared but can be configured within `sdmTMBcontrol()` via the `map` argument.

Geostatistical models are best fit in a coordinate space where distance is constant.
For smaller spatial areas, UTMs are commonly used, but these datasets spanned well beyond one UTM zone introducing considerable distortion.
Instead, we chose a custom Albers projection with reference longitudes at approximately 1/6 from the bottom and top of the data---future work could investigate the impact of this decision, but our initial observations suggest this had a minimal impact on model predictions.
We fit out models with coordinates in 100 km units so that the spatial parameters were on an appropriate scale for estimation.
We configured the mesh to have a 'cutoff' of 500 km for the full dataset and 300 km for the US-fleet data set, which means no triangle edge is allowed to be smaller than 500 or 300 km, respectively. 
This mesh has approximately 250 triangle vertices or 'knots' for both datasets.
Model convergence can be sensitive to the exact mesh configuration---a problem that can often be alleviated by increasing or reducing the mesh resolution or, more elegantly, applying penalized complexity priors [REF], which could be explored in future work (available within `sdmTMBpriors()` via `pc_matern()`).

sdmTMB uses a projection matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$, calculated through R-INLA, to bilinearly interpolate random field values at triangle vertex locations ($\boldsymbol{\omega}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^*$) to the values at the locations of the observed or predicted data [@lindgren2015]: $\boldsymbol{\omega}^* = \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\omega}$ and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}^* = \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$.
The matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ has a row for each data point and a column for each vertex defining the weight of the neighbouring three vertices.

sdmTMB minimizes the negative marginal log likelihood---calculated via TMB---with the non-linear optimization routine `stats::nlminb()` in R [@gay1990; @r2021] followed by a Newton optimization routine `stats::optimHess()` in R [@r2021] to further reduce the likelihood gradients with respect to fixed effects if needed.
Using `sdmTMB::sanity()`, we assessed convergence by checking that the Hessian matrix was positive definite, that all gradients with respect to fixed effects were $<$ 0.001, and that no random field standard deviations were too small (< 0.01; suggesting the parameter had 'collapsed' to zero) among other checks.

To derive predicted total bycatch on the logbook data, we predicted from our model on the logbook data and summed the predicted bycatch each year.
We calculated standard errors on the log value of this total via the generalized delta method [as implemented in TMB, @kristensen2016] and calculated 95% Wald confidence intervals as $\pm$ 1.96 the standard error in log space.
We compared models with AIC, evaluated model fit via randomized quantile residuals, and calculated summary statistics of MARE (median absolute relative error), MRE (mean relative error), and coverage (the proportion of years in which the true value was within the confidence interval).

# Results

- seems to be strong anisotropy Fig.\ \@ref(fig:aniso) ... but think about projection
- coverage worse and metrics worse if no spatiotemporal or no fields at all
- convergence can be finicky with properties of mesh! priors would help
- exactly which family comes out on top is sensitive to the mesh
- all decent families
- just spatial gets you most of the way there
- adding spatiotemporal helps a bit and mostly with appropriate CI coverage
- big benefit adding spatial fields, smaller benefit adding spatiotemporal
- NB2 or NB2 consistently had coverage closest to 95%
- spatiotemporal sigmaE collapsed for delta US models
